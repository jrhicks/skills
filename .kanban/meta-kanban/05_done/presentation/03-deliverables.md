# Deliverables

## Numbering Convention

Root-level deliverables numbered sequentially across stages. Subfolder deliverables numbered within each folder starting from 01. Supporting folders share the same number and name as the root file they support.

Deliverables accumulate -- all files stay in the folder as it moves through stages.

**Compilation files guide next steps.** Each stage produces brainstorm files (supplemental, exploratory) and a compilation file that locks in decisions (`03-shape.md`, `04-outline.md`, `05-spec.md`). The next stage reads the compilation, not the brainstorms. Brainstorms stay as reference but don't drive downstream work.

## Per-Stage Deliverables

### Brain-dump

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01-brain-dump.md` | TLDR of what was dumped |
| `02-brain-dump/` | Folder for raw attachments (images, links, notes) |

### Shape

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `03-shape/01-grounding.md` | Audience, situating, fencing |
| `03-shape/02-core.md` | Salient idea, story, surprise |
| `03-shape/03-packaging.md` | Symbol, slogan, empowerment promise |
| `03-shape.md` | Locked-in shape merging all brainstorms |

### Outline (label-branched)

**inform:**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `04-outline/01-sections.md` | Section outline + board vs slides |
| `04-outline/02-delivery.md` | Cycling, hooks, start/stop |
| `04-outline.md` | Locked-in outline |

**expose / persuade:**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `04-outline/01-vision.md` | Vision statement |
| `04-outline/02-done-something.md` | Steps enumerated |
| `04-outline/03-contributions.md` | What you accomplished |
| `04-outline/04-sections.md` | Section outline + slides vs board |
| `04-outline/05-delivery.md` | Cycling, hooks, start/stop |
| `04-outline.md` | Locked-in outline |

Sub-skills know which deliverables to create per type -- no runtime inference needed.

### Specify

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `05-spec.md` | Slide-by-slide blueprint with content, delivery cues, verbal punctuation, speaker notes. |

### Produce

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `produce/assets/` | Images, symbols, generated graphics |
| `produce/assets/chalkboard-sequences/` | Chalkboard animation frame pairs |
| `produce/assets/prop-sequences/` | Prop illustration frame pairs (editorial style) |
| `produce/speaker-notes.md` | Standalone speaker notes |
| `produce/presentation.pptx` | Final deck (.gitignore) |
| `produce/presentation.pdf` | PDF export (.gitignore) |

Upload to Google Slides as final step.
