## What Moves

A presentation folder in kebab-case (e.g., `all-hands-q1`, `hts-demo-talk`). Minimum content on creation: `card.md`.

## Stage Dependencies

Strictly sequential. Each stage builds on the prior stage's deliverables.

## Done Flow

Auto-done. Sub-skill marks done and advances to the next stage in one motion. No manual "ready to pull" gate.
