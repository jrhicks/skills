# How to Speak

**Patrick Winston, MIT** -- Lecture transcript from MIT's "How to Speak" IAP session.

Winston's thesis: Your success in life is determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas -- in that order. Communication quality follows a formula: **Knowledge + Practice + talent**, where talent is the smallest factor. What matters most is what you know about speaking.

## How to Start

**Don't start with a joke.** At the beginning, people are still settling in and adjusting to your vocal parameters. Jokes fall flat.

**Start with an empowerment promise.** Tell people what they will know at the end that they didn't know at the beginning. This is their reason for being there.

> "At the end of this 60 minutes you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things will make a difference in your life."

## Four Heuristics for Engaging an Audience

### 1. Cycle

Go around the subject multiple times. Not because your audience is unintelligent -- at any given moment about 20% will be fogged out. Cycling ensures the probability that everyone gets it is high.

### 2. Build a Fence

Distinguish your idea from others' ideas. "My algorithm might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential and mine is linear." Fencing prevents confusion about how your idea relates to others.

### 3. Verbal Punctuation

Provide landmark moments where people can get back on the bus. Enumerate. Announce structure. "The first idea is cycling. The second idea is building a fence. And now the third idea is verbal punctuation." Seams in the talk let people re-engage.

### 4. Ask a Question

Carefully chosen questions re-engage the audience. You can wait about 7 seconds of silence for an answer -- it feels like eternity but is the standard. The question can't be too obvious (embarrassing) or too hard (silence).

---

## Time and Place

**Best time:** 11:00 AM. Most people are awake, nobody is going back to sleep, not right after a meal.

**Lighting:** Keep lights full up. Dimmed lights signal sleep. "It's extremely hard to see slides through closed eyelids."

**Case the room.** Visit the space beforehand to handle any surprises. Winston imagines seats filled with "disinterested farm animals" so nothing can be worse than expected.

**Right-size the room.** More than half full. Ten people in a large hall makes everyone wonder what's wrong.

## Tools of the Trade

### The Board (Blackboard/Whiteboard)

Best for **informing** -- teaching, lecturing.

Three virtues:
1. **Graphic quality** -- you can draw, diagram, visualize naturally
2. **Speed** -- writing speed matches the speed people absorb ideas (slides flip too fast)
3. **Target** -- gives you something to do with your hands. Novice speakers suddenly become aware of their hands. Pointing at the board creates engagement even when what you're pointing at isn't directly relevant

**Empathetic mirroring:** When watching someone write on a board or manipulate a physical object, mirror neurons activate. The audience feels themselves doing it. This is why boards and props are more engaging than slides -- you need to see it in the physical world.

**Adapting for Zoom/virtual:** You can't walk to a board in a virtual presentation, but you can simulate it with **chalkboard sequence slides** -- 2 back-to-back slides that progressively reveal a drawing on a green chalkboard background. These are separate from your polished slides (a deliberate mode switch, not a mixed-in illustration). See [`chalk-board.md`](chalk-board.md) for the workflow using Nano Banana.

### Props

Playwrights are the custodians of prop knowledge. In Ibsen's *Hedda Gabler*, a pot-bellied stove with growing fire and a manuscript create unbearable tension -- you know the manuscript is going into the fire.

Props are memorable. Jim Glass remembered a talk 20 years later because "that's the one where you broke the pointer."

**Example:** A spinning bicycle wheel with duct tape teaches gyroscopic precession better than any equation. Think about just the piece under the tape, not the whole wheel.

**Example:** Alan Lazarus put his head against a wall and released a pendulum ball -- it swings away and returns to barely kiss his nose. Seconds of "this guy really believes in the conservation of energy." (Don't try this at home -- the natural tendency is to push, not just release.)

### Slides

Best for **exposing** ideas (job talks, conference talks) -- not for teaching them.

**Universal truth:** There are always too many slides and always too many words.

**Crimes to avoid:**

| Crime | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Too many words | Reduce to essential phrases. Small fonts = too many words. Minimum ~40pt. |
| Speaker far from slides | Stay near your visual material. Avoid the tennis-match head-turning. |
| Reading slides aloud | Your audience can read. Reading insults them and wastes your voice. |
| Background clutter | Remove logos, decorative elements, unnecessary titles. |
| Laser pointer | You turn your back, lose eye contact. Use arrows on the slide instead. |
| Too heavy | Print slides, lay on table. If there's no air/white space, it's too heavy. |

**The language processor problem:** Humans have one language processor. Slides with lots of text force people to read instead of listen. In an experiment, students remembered what was on slides better than what the speaker said. One subject: "I wish you hadn't talked so much, it was distracting."

**Hapax legomenon:** A slide so complex it's intentionally incomprehensible -- that IS the point (e.g., the Afghanistan governance complexity diagram). You get exactly one per presentation.

## Inspiring an Audience

Winston surveyed people across MIT about what inspires them:

- **Incoming freshmen:** Inspired by a teacher who told them they could do it
- **Senior faculty:** Inspired by someone who helped them see a problem in a new way
- **Everyone:** Inspired by someone who exhibited **passion** about what they were doing

Express how cool something is. Show genuine excitement.

**Example:** A coloring algorithm that takes longer than the lifetime of the solar system -- but with one adjustment, finishes in seconds. "Isn't that cool?"

## Teaching People How to Think

We are storytelling animals. We develop story skills from fairy tales through professional school and beyond. Teaching people to think means providing:

- Stories they need to know
- Questions to ask about those stories
- Mechanisms for analyzing stories
- Ways of putting stories together
- Ways of evaluating story reliability

## Persuading: Oral Exams

The most common reason people fail oral exams: **failure to situate**. Place your research in context -- what problem, how long unsolved, why it matters, what impact it would have.

**Practice with the right people.** Not officemates or your advisor -- they know your work and will hallucinate that material is in your presentation when it isn't. Practice with friends who don't know your work. Tell them: "If you can't make me cry, I won't value you as a friend anymore."

**Difficulty is proportional to age.** Young examiners try to prove how smart they are. Senior examiners understand where they are in the world. Prefer gray hair on your committee.

---

## Persuading: Job Talks

Winston asked two colleagues -- Dolores Etter (21 books) and Bill Weldon (rail guns through tank armor) -- what they look for in faculty candidates:

- **Dolores:** "They have to show us they've got some kind of vision."
- **Bill:** "They have to show us they've done something."

**How long do they have?** Five minutes. If you haven't expressed your vision and demonstrated accomplishment in five minutes, you've already lost.

### Structure

1. **Vision** = a problem somebody cares about + something new in your approach
2. **Done something** = enumerate the steps needed to achieve the solution. You don't have to have done all of them: "Here's what needs to be done. We need to specify behavior, enumerate constraints, implement a system -- and we've built such a system and we're about to demonstrate it."
3. **Content** (the body of your talk)
4. **Contributions** = mirror of the steps, establishing what you've accomplished

## Getting Famous (Getting Your Work Recognized)

Julia Child on fame: "You get used to it." But you never get used to being ignored.

> "Your ideas are like your children, and you don't want them to go into the world in rags."

### Winston's Star (5 S's)

Every element starts with S. Winston's PhD work on arch learning accidentally had all five, which is why it became well-known:

| Element | Description | Arch Example |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Symbol** | A visual/icon associated with your work | The arch itself |
| **Slogan** | A phrase that provides a handle | "One-shot learning" |
| **Surprise** | Something unexpected | You don't need a million examples |
| **Salient idea** | One idea that sticks out (not just important -- prominent) | The concept of a "near miss" |
| **Story** | How you did it, how it works, why it matters | The narrative of learning from examples |

A thesis with too many good ideas can fail because none sticks out. You need one salient idea.

## How to Stop

### The Final Slide

| Slide Type | Verdict | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Long list of collaborators | Bad | Suggests nobody knows who did significant work. Put collaborators on the **first** slide. |
| "Questions?" | Bad | Can stay up for 20 minutes. Squanders real estate. |
| "Thank You" | Bad | Wastes opportunity. |
| "The End" | Bad | Wastes opportunity. |
| "Conclusions" | Mediocre | People don't care about conclusions. They care about what you **did**. |
| **"Contributions"** | **Best** | Lists what you accomplished. Stays up during Q&A. Tells people who you are. |

### The Final Words

| Ending | Verdict | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| A joke | Good | By end of talk, audience has adjusted to your voice. Doug Lenat: "I always finish with a joke -- that way people think they've had fun the whole time." |
| "Thank you" | Weak | Implies audience stayed out of politeness and wanted to be somewhere else. |
| Benediction | Good | "God bless you and God bless America" (political speeches). |
| Salute the audience | Good | Express how much you value your time with them. "It's been fascinating to see what you folks are doing..." |

**You don't have to say "thank you."** Once applause starts you can mouth it, but it shouldn't be your final deliberate words. There are conventions that signal the end: in Catholic mass, "Ite, missa est" (the mass is over, you can go home); at concerts, the conductor shakes hands with the concertmaster.

## Quick Reference: Winston's Rules

1. Start with an empowerment promise, not a joke
2. Cycle on your subject (say it three times)
3. Build a fence around your idea
4. Use verbal punctuation (enumerate, announce structure)
5. Ask carefully chosen questions (wait 7 seconds)
6. 11 AM, well-lit room, right-sized, cased in advance
7. Board for teaching, slides for exposing
8. Props create empathetic mirroring and are memorable
9. Slides: fewer words, bigger fonts, no laser pointer, remove clutter
10. Show passion -- it's the universal inspiration signal
11. Job talks: vision + done something, established in 5 minutes
12. Winston's Star: Symbol, Slogan, Surprise, Salient idea, Story
13. Final slide = Contributions (not collaborators, questions, or thank you)
14. Final words = joke, benediction, or salute (not "thank you")
