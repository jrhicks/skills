# Time and Place

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

So next thing on our agenda as we start to discuss these other things is a discussion of time and place.

## Time

So what do you think is a good time to have a lecture? 11:00 AM. Yeah, and the reason is most people at MIT are awake by then and hardly anyone is going back to sleep. It's not right after a meal. People aren't fatigued from this or that. It's a great time to have a lecture.

## Place

So that brings me next to the question of what about the place. And the most important thing about the place is that it be well lit. This room is well lit. Problem with the other kinds of rooms is that we humans -- whenever the lights go down or whenever the room is dimly lighted it signals that we should go to sleep. So whenever I go somewhere to give a talk, even today, the first thing I do when I speak to the audiovisual people is say "keep the lights full up." Oh, they might reply, "people will see the slides better if we turn the lights off." And then I reply, "it's extremely hard to see slides through closed eyelids."

## Case the Room

What else can you say about the place? Well, the place should be cased, and I mean that in the classical sense of like if you're robbing a bank you would go to the bank some occasions before to see what it's like so there are no surprises when you do your robbery.

So whenever I go somewhere to speak the first thing I ask my host to do is to take me to the place where I'll be speaking so that any weirdnesses I'll be able to deal with. Sometimes it might require some intervention. Sometimes it just might require me to understand what the challenges are.

So when I came here this morning I did what I typically do -- I imagined that all the seats were filled with disinterested farm animals. That way I knew that no matter how bad it was it wouldn't be as bad as that.

## Right-Size the Room

Finally it should be reasonably populated. It should be the case that -- you know, if there are 10 people in this hall everyone would be wondering "what's going on that's so much more interesting that nobody's here." So you want to get a right-sized place -- it doesn't have to be packed but it has to be more than half full.

So those are some thoughts about time and place.
