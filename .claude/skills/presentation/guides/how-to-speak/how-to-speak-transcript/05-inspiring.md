# Inspiring

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

---

Well now, that's a quick review of tools. Now I want to talk about some special cases. We could talk a little bit about informing -- or to say it another way, doing what I'm doing now. But I'll just say a few words about that.

## The Promise, Then Inspire

In that kind of presentation you want to start with a promise, like I did for this hour that we're going through now. But then it comes to the question of how do you inspire people?

I've given this talk for a long time and a few years ago our department chairman said "would you please give this talk to new faculty and be sure to emphasize what it takes to inspire students." And strangely I hadn't thought about that question before. So I started a survey. I talked to some of my incoming freshman advisees and I talked to senior faculty and everything in between about how they've been inspired.

What I found from the incoming freshmen is that they were inspired by some high school teacher who told them they could do it.

What I found in the senior faculty -- they were inspired by someone who helped them to see a problem in a new way.

And what I saw from everyone is that they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing. Exhibited passion about what they were doing.

## Passion

Yeah so that's one way to be inspiring. It's easy for me because, you know, I do artificial intelligence. And how can you not be interested in artificial intelligence, right? I mean if you're not interested in artificial intelligence you're probably not interested in interesting things. So when I'm lecturing in my AI class it's natural for me to talk about what I think is cool and how exciting some new idea is. So that's the kind of expression of passion that makes a difference while informing.

## Express How Cool Stuff Is

With respect to this question of inspiring -- oh yeah, and of course during this promise phase you can also express how cool stuff is. Let me give you an example of a lecture that starts this way.

I'm talking about resource allocation. It's the same sort of ideas you would need if you're allocating aircraft to a flight schedule or trying to schedule a factory or something like that. But the example is putting colors on the states in the United States without any bordering states having the same color.

So here it goes -- this is what I show in the beginning of the class. This is a way of doing that coloring. And you might say "well why don't we wait till it finishes? Would you like to do that?" No. Well we're not going to wait till it finishes because the sun will have exploded and consumed the Earth before this program finishes. But with a slight adjustment to how the program works -- which I tell my students you will understand in the next 50 minutes -- this is what you get.

Isn't that cool? You know, you got to be amazed by stuff that takes a computation from longer than the lifetime of the solar system into a few seconds.

So that's what I mean by providing a promise up front and expressing some passion about what you're talking about.

## Teaching People How to Think

Well the last item in this little block here has to do with what people think that they do at MIT. You ask a faculty member what the most important purpose is and they'll say "well, the most important thing I do is teach people how to think." And then you say "oh that's great, how do you teach people how to think?" Blank stare. No one can quite respond to that natural next question.

So how do you teach people how to think? Well I believe that we are storytelling animals. And that we start developing our story understanding and manipulating skills with fairy tales in childhood and continue on through professional schools like law, business, medicine, engineering -- everything. And we continue doing that throughout life.

So if that is what thinking is all about, then when you want to teach people how to think you provide them with:

- The stories they need to know
- The questions they need to ask about those stories
- Mechanisms for analyzing those stories
- Ways of putting stories together
- Ways of evaluating how reliable the story is

And that's what I think you need to do when you teach people how to think.
