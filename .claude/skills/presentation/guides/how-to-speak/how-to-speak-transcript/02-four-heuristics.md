# Four Heuristics

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

So now that I've talked a little bit about how to start, what I want to do is give you some samples of tics that are always on my mind when I give a talk.

## 1. Cycling

And first of these tics is that it's a good idea to cycle on the subject. Go around it, go around it again, go around again. Some people say "tell them what you want to tell them, tell them again, and then tell them a third time" as if people weren't intelligent. But the point is -- the reason is -- well there are many reasons, one of which is at any given moment about 20% of you will be fogged out no matter what the lecture is. So if you want to ensure that the probability that everybody gets it is high, you need to say it three times. So cycling is one of the things that I always think about when I give a talk.

## 2. Building a Fence

Another thing I think about is -- in explaining my idea I want to build a fence around it so that it's not confused with somebody else's idea. So if you were from Mars and I was teaching you about what an arch is, I might say to you "well that's an arch, and that's not to be confused with some other things that other people might think is an arch. This is not an arch. That's not an arch." I'm building a fence around my idea so that it can be distinguished from somebody else's idea.

So in a more technical sense I might say "well my algorithm might seem similar to Jones's algorithm except his is exponential and mine's linear." That's putting a fence around your idea so that people cannot be confused about how it might relate to something else.

## 3. Verbal Punctuation

The third thing on this list of samples is the idea of verbal punctuation. And the idea here is that because people will occasionally fog out and need to get back on the bus, you need to provide some landmark places where you're announcing that it's a good time to get back on.

So I might in this talk say something about this being my outline. The first thing we're going to do is talk about how to start. Then we're going to deal with these four samples. And among these four samples I've talked about the first idea, that's cycling. The second idea, building a fence. And now the third idea is verbal punctuation. So I'm enumerating. I'm providing numbers. I'm giving you a sense that there's a seam in the talk and you can get back on.

## 4. Ask a Question

Okay so now we're on a roll, and since we're on a roll can you guess what the fourth idea might be here? An idea that helps people get back on the bus? Yes -- ask a question. Ask a question, yes, thank you.

So ask a question. And so I will ask a question: how much dead air can there be? How long can I pause? I counted 7 seconds. It seems like an eternity to me to wait and not say anything for 7 seconds, but that's the standard amount of time you can wait for an answer. And of course the question has to be carefully chosen. It can't be too obvious because then people will be embarrassed to say what the answer is. Can't be too hard because nobody will have anything to say.

So here are some sample heuristics you can put in your armorium and build up your repertoire of ideas about presentation.

And now if this persuades you that there is something to know, that there is knowledge, then I've already succeeded. Because what I want to convince you of is -- if you watch the speakers you admire and feel are effective and ask yourselves why they're successful, then you can build up your own personal repertoire and develop your own personal style. And that's my fundamental objective. And the rest of this talk is about some of the things that are in my armorium that I think are effective.
