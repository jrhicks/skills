# How to Stop

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

---

Well, we're almost finished because now we're down to this last item which is how to stop. And when we come to that there's a question of all right, well what is the final slide and what are the final words.

## The Final Slide

So for the final slide let me give you some examples of possibilities.

**Collaborators slide.** How about this one? Well you might see that slide and think to yourself "there are a thousand faculty at MIT -- nice piece of work but not so much but it's only a tiny piece of work if you divide by a thousand." So when you show a whole gigantic list of collaborators at the end of a talk it's a kind of letdown because it suggests that nobody knows -- well, did you do anything significant?

Now you got to recognize your collaborators, right? So where do you do that? Not on the last slide -- on the first slide. All this was on the first slide. These are the collaborators. So you don't want to put them at the end.

**"Questions?" slide.** You don't want a slide like this. How about this one? This is the worst possible way to end a talk because this slide can be up there for 20 minutes. I've seen it happen. It squanders real estate. It squanders an opportunity to tell people who you are. It's just --

**"Thank You" slide.** What about this one? I often see it. I've never seen anybody write it down. Also it wastes opportunity.

**"The End" slide.** Oh my God, even worse. All of these slides do nothing for you. They waste an opportunity for you to tell people -- to leave people with who you are.

**"Conclusions" slide.** Well what about this -- is this a good one? It might seem so at first but here's the problem. If you say these are my conclusions -- these are perfectly legitimate conclusions that nobody cares about. What they care about is what you have done.

**"Contributions" slide.** And that's why your final slide should have this label: contributions. It's a mirror of what I said over there about how job talks ought to be like a sandwich. And the final slide -- the one that's up there while people are asking questions and filing out -- it ought to be the one that has your contributions on it.

Here's an example from my own stump speech. Yeah, this is what I talk about a lot. Yes, here are the things that I typically demonstrate. And I wait for people to read it. And then the final element there is "this is what we get out of it." So that's an example of a contributions slide.

## The Final Words

All right, now what about the other part? You know, you got your final slide up there, it's a contributions slide. Somehow you have to tell people you're finished. So let's check out a few possibilities.

**A joke.** One thing you could do in the final words is you could tell a joke. It's okay -- by the time you're done people have adjusted themselves to your voice parameters. They're ready for a joke. I was sitting in another bar, this time in Austin, Texas, with a colleague of mine named Doug Lenat. And Doug's a fantastic speaker. And so I said to Doug "Doug, you're a fantastic speaker, what's your secret?" And he said "oh, I always finish with a joke. And that way people think they've had fun the whole time." So yeah, a joke will work down there.

**"Thank you."** How about this one -- thank you? I don't recommend it. It's a weak move. You will not go to hell if you conclude your talk by saying thank you, but it's a weak move. And here's why. When you say thank you -- even worse, "thank you for listening" -- it suggests that everybody has stayed that long out of politeness and that they had a profound desire to be somewhere else but they're so polite they stuck it out. And that's what you're thanking them for.

So once wild applause has started you can mouth a thank you and there's nothing wrong with that. But the last thing you do should not be saying thank you.

Now do you say to me "well doesn't everybody say thank you?" Well, what everybody does is not necessarily the right thing.

**Political examples.** And I'd like to illustrate how some talks can end without saying thank you. I like to draw from political speeches but the ones that I've heard recently aren't so good so I'm going to have to go back a little bit.

So here's Governor Christie. He gave the Republican keynote address one year. This is the end of his talk. Let's see what he does:

> "And together, everybody together, we will stand up once again for American greatness, for our children and grandchildren. God bless you and God bless America."

That's a classic benediction ending. God bless you, God bless America.

Now I don't want to be partisan about this so I think I better switch to the keynote address in the Democratic Convention. It was delivered that year by Bill Clinton, who knows something about how to speak:

> "If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote and you must reelect President Barack Obama. God bless you and God bless America."

Now watch this. Let's go back a little bit and redo it. What I want you to see is that at one point he seems to be almost pressing his lips together, forcing himself not to say thank you. And then there's another place where he does a little salute. So watch for those this time around:

> "If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote and you must reelect President Barack Obama. God bless you and God bless America."

Everybody -- he's pursing his lips. There's a salute. Yeah, I think that's pretty good.

## Other Ways to End

Now what are we going to take away from this? Well, I suppose I can conclude this talk by saying "God bless you and God bless the Massachusetts Institute of Technology" but it might not work so well. But what you can get out of this is you don't have to say thank you. There are other things you can do.

And you know it's interesting that over time people figure this out and there are some stock ways of ending things. So in the Catholic church in a good old Latin mass it ended with "ite, missa est" -- which translates approximately to "okay, the mass is over, you can go home now." And of course at musical concerts you know that it's time to clap not at the end of the song but rather when the conductor goes over and shakes hands with the concertmaster. Those are conventions that tell you that the event is over.

So those are all possibilities for here. But one more possibility -- and that is that you can salute the audience. And by that I mean you can say something about how much you value your time and place.

So I could say "well it's been great fun being here. It's been fascinating to see what you folks are doing here at MIT. I've been stimulated and provoked by the kinds of questions you've been asking. It's been really great. And I look forward to coming back on many occasions in the future."

So that salutes the audience. You can do that.

---

Well there it is. You know what -- I'm glad you're here. And the reason is, by being here I think you have demonstrated an understanding that how you present and how you package your ideas is an important thing. And I salute you for that. And I suggest that you come back again and bring your friends.

[Applause]
