# Job Talks (and Oral Exams)

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

But that's all about education. And many of you here not necessarily for that but rather for this part -- for persuading. Which breaks down into several categories: oral exams (not shown), job talks, getting famous.

## Oral Exams

I won't say much about oral exams other than the fact that they used to be a lot scarier than they are today. In the old days, reading the literature in a foreign language was a part of that. And there was a high failure rate. And when you look back on those failures, the most usual reason for people failing an oral exam is failure to situate and a failure to practice.

**Situate.** By situate I mean it's important to talk about your research in context. "This is a problem that's being pursued all over the world. There hasn't been any progress before me in the past 30 years. Everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things." So that's situating -- in time and place and field.

**Practice with the right people.** And then as far as practice is concerned -- yes, practice is important. But that doesn't mean showing your slides to the people who share an office with you. The problem with that is that if people know what you're doing they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there. It isn't there.

A variation on the scene by the way is your faculty supervisor is not a very good person to help you debug a talk because they in fact know what you're doing and they will in fact hallucinate there's material in your presentation that isn't there.

So you need to get together some friends who don't know what you're doing and have them -- well you start the practice session by saying "if you can't make me cry I won't value you as a friend anymore."

**Difficulty is proportional to age.** And then when you get to the faculty on an oral exam it will be easy. You see, the amount of flack you get from somebody is proportional to age. The older somebody is, the more they understand where they are in the world. But the young people are trying to show the old people how smart they are -- so savagely vicious. So whenever you have an opportunity to have an examining committee that's full of people with gray hair, that's what you want.

## Job Talks

Well that's just a word or two about something I haven't listed here. Let's get into the subject of job talks.

**Vision and accomplishment.** So I was sitting in a bar many years ago in San Diego. I was a member of the Navy Science Board. And I was sitting with a couple of my colleagues on the board -- Dolores Etter from the University of Colorado. She made me so jealous I could spit because she'd written 21 books and I'd only written 17. And then the other one was Bill Weldon from the University of Texas. He was an electromagnetism guy and he knew how to use rail guns to drive steel rods through tank armor. These are interesting people.

So I said "what do you look for in a faculty candidate?" And within one microsecond Dolores said "they have to show us they've got some kind of vision." Quickly followed by Bill who said "they have to show us that they've done something."

"Oh that sounds good," I said. And then I said to them "how long does the candidate have to establish these two things?"

What do you think? Compare your answer to theirs.

Five minutes.

So if you haven't expressed your vision, if you haven't told people that you've done something in five minutes -- you've already lost. So you have to be able to do that.

## Expressing Vision

And let me just mention a couple of things in that connection here. Which is -- you know, the vision is in part a problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach.

So the problem is understanding the nature of human intelligence. And the approach is asking questions about what makes us different from chimpanzees and Neanderthals. Is it merely a matter of quantity, or are we just a little bit smarter in some continuous way, or do we have something that's fundamentally different that the chimpanzees don't have and the Neanderthals either?

And the answer is yes, we do have something different. We are symbolic creatures. And because we're symbolic creatures we can build symbolic descriptions of relations and events. We can string them together and make stories. And because we can make stories, that's what makes us different.

So that's my stump speech. That's how I start most of my talks on my own personal research.

## Demonstrating Accomplishment

How do you express the notion that you've done something? By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to that problem. You don't have to have done all of those steps. But you can say "here's what needs to be done."

An example: "Here's what needs to be done. We need to specify some behavior. We need to enumerate the constraints that make it possible to deal with that behavior. We have to implement a system because we're engineers and we don't think that we've understood something unless we can build it. And we've built such a system and we're about to demonstrate it to you today."

That would be an example of enumerating a series of steps needed to realize the vision.

## The Sandwich Structure

So then -- blah blah blah blah blah blah -- and then you conclude by enumerating your contributions. It's a kind of mirror of these steps and helps to establish that you've done something.

So that's a kind of general-purpose framework for doing a technical talk.
