# How to Start

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

---

The uh uniform code of military Justice specifies Court marshal for any officer who sends a soldier into battle without a weapon. There ought to be a similar protection for students because students shouldn't go out into life without an ability to communicate. And that's because your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas -- in that order.

I know that I can be successful in this because the quality of communication -- your speaking, your writing -- is largely determined by this formula. It's a matter of how much knowledge you have, how much you practice with that knowledge, and your inherent talent. And notice that the T is very small. What really matters is what you know.

This point came to me suddenly a few decades ago when I was skiing at Sun Valley. I had heard that it was celebrity weekend and one of the celebrities was Mary Lou Retton, famous Olympic gymnast, perfect tens in the vault. And I heard that she was a novice at skiing. So when the opportune moment arrived I looked over on a novice slope and saw this young woman who when she became unbalanced went like that, and I said that's got to be her, that must be the gymnast. But then it occurred to me -- I'm a much better skier than she is, and she's an Olympic Athlete. Not only an ordinary Olympic Athlete, an outstanding one. And I was a better skier because I had the K and I had the P and all she had was the T. So you can get a lot better than people who may have inherent talents if you have the right amount of knowledge.

So that's what my objective is today. And here's my promise: today you will see some examples of what you can put in your armorium of speaking techniques, and it will be the case that some of those examples, some heuristic, some technique -- maybe only one -- will be the one that gets you the job. And so this is a very nonlinear process. You never know when it's going to happen. But that is my promise. By the end of the next 60 minutes you'll have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you'll incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.

Now in order to do that we have to have a rule of engagement and that is no laptops, no cell phones. So if you could close those I'll start up as soon as you're done. Some people ask why that is a rule of engagement and the answer is we humans only have one language processor. And if your language processor is engaged browsing the web or reading your email you're distracted. And worse yet you distract all the people around you -- studies have shown that. And worse yet if I see an open laptop somewhere back there or up here it drives me nuts and I do a worse job. And so that ensures that all of your friends who are paying attention don't get the performance that they came to have.

So that's it for preamble. Let's get started.

First thing to talk about of course is how to start. Some people think the right thing to do is to start a talk with a joke. I don't recommend it. And the reason is that in the beginning of a talk people are still putting their laptops away, they're becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters, to your vocal parameters, and they're not ready for a joke. So it doesn't work very well -- they usually fall flat.

What you want to do instead is start with an empowerment promise. You want to tell people what they're going to know at the end of the hour that they didn't know at the beginning of the hour. It's an empowerment promise. It's the reason for being here.

What would be an example? Oh, I see -- at the end of this 60 minutes you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life. Yeah, that's an empowerment promise. So that's the best way to start.
