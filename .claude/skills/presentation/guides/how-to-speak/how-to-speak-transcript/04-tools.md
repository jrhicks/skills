# Tools: Boards, Props, and Slides

*Raw transcript -- Patrick Winston, MIT "How to Speak"*

---

Next thing I want to talk about is the subject of boards and props and slides. Well these are the tools of the trade.

## The Board

I believe that this is the right tool for speaking when your purpose is informing. The slides are good when your purpose is exposing. But this is what I use when I'm informing, teaching, lecturing. And there are several reasons why I use it.

**Graphic quality.** For one thing when you use the board you have a graphic quality. It's the case that when you have a board then you can easily exploit the fact that you can use graphics in your presentation. So that's the graphic quality that I like.

**Speed.** And next thing I like is like a speed property. The speed with which you write on the blackboard is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas. If you go flipping through a bunch of slides nobody can go that fast.

**Target.** Finally one great property of a board is that it can be a target. Many people who are novices at speaking find themselves suddenly aware of their hands. It's as if their hands were private parts that shouldn't be exposed in public. So right away they go into the pockets -- and this is considered insulting in some parts of the world. Or alternatively maybe the hands will go in back like this.

I was once in a convent in Serbia and my host -- well, we were -- as soon as we entered a nun came up to us and offered us a refreshment. And I was about to say no thank you when he said "eat that stuff or die" -- it's a question of local custom and politeness. But then before anything happened there the nun pulled my hands off like this because it was extraordinarily insulting in that culture to have your hands behind your back. So why is that? Well it's usually supposed that that has to do with whether you're concealing a weapon. So if your hands are in your pockets or behind your back then it looks like you might have a weapon.

And that's what I mean by the virtue -- one of these virtues of the board. Now you have something to do with your hands. You can point out the stuff. I was once watching Seymour Papert give a lecture. I thought it was terrific so I went a second time -- first time to absorb the content, second time to note the style. And what I discovered is that Papert was constantly pointing at the board. And then I thought about it a little while and I noted that none of the stuff he was pointing to had anything to do with what he was saying. Nevertheless it was an effective technique.

## Props

So that's a just a little bit about the virtue of blackboards. And now I want to talk about props. You know the custodians of knowledge about props are the playwrights.

**Hedda Gabler.** Many decades ago I saw a play by Henrik Ibsen. It was Hedda Gabler. I remember vaguely there was about a woman in an unhappy marriage and her husband was in competition for an academic job with somebody else. And he was going to lose partly because he was boring and partly because the competitor had just written a magnificent book. By the way this is back in the days before there were copying machines and computers.

Anyhow, as the play opens there's a pot bellied stove. And in the beginning of the play the pot belly stove with its open door just has some slightly glowing embers. But the pot stove is always there. And tension mounts in the play and you see this manuscript -- this prop that Ibsen so artfully used. You just know that something's going to happen because as the play goes on the fire gets bigger and hotter and finally all consuming. And you just know that that manuscript is going to go into that fire. It's a memorable thing -- it's what I remember about the play. So the playwrights have got this all figured out.

**The bicycle wheel.** But on the other hand they're not the only people who can use props. Here's an example of the use of a prop, also due to Seymour Papert. He was talking about how it's important to look at the problem in the right way. And here's an example that not only teaches that but makes it possible for you to embarrass your friends in mechanical engineering.

So here's what you do. Take this bicycle wheel. You start it spinning and then you put some torque on the axle or equivalently you blow on the edge. And the issue is does it go that way or does it go that way? Now the mechanical engineers will immediately say "oh yes, I see, right hand screw" and they'll put their fingers in this position but forget exactly how to align their fingers with various aspects of the problem. And so it's usually the case that they get it right with about a 50% probability. So their very fancy education gets them up to the point where they're equivalent to flipping a coin.

But it doesn't have to be that way because you can think about the problem a little differently. So here's what you do -- you take some duct tape and you put it around part of the wheel like that. And now you start to think about not the whole wheel but just the little piece that's underneath the duct tape. So here that piece comes rolling over the top and at this point you blow on it with a puff of air -- forgetting about the rest of the wheel, what happens to that little piece that's under the duct tape? It must want to go that way cuz you bang on it like that, it's already going down like that. And what about the next piece? Same thing. Next piece? Same thing. So the only thing that can happen is the wheel goes over like that. And so now you'll never wonder again because you're thinking about the problem in the right way. And it's demonstrated by the use of a prop. You can try this after we're done.

**The pendulum.** Another example I like to remember is one from when I was taking 801. Alan Lazarus was the instructor at the time and he was talking about the conservation of energy, kinetic and potential. And there was a long wire in the ceiling in 26-100 attached to a much bigger steel ball, but one not unlike this. And Lazarus took the ball up against the wall like this, he put his head flat against the wall to steady himself, and then he let go. And the pendulum takes many seconds to go over and back and then gently kisses Lazarus's nose. And so you have many seconds to think "this guy really believes in the conservation of energy."

Do not try this at home. The problem is that first time you do this you may not just let go -- there's a natural human tendency to push.

## Empathetic Mirroring

So that's a little bit on the subject of props. You know it's interesting whenever surveys are taken students always say "more chalk, less PowerPoint." And why would that be? Props are always also very effective -- why would that be?

I'll give you my lunatic fringe view on this. It has to do with what I would call empathetic mirroring. When you're sitting up there watching me write on the board, all those little mirror neurons in your head I believe become actuated and you can feel yourself writing on the blackboard. And even more so when I talk about this steel ball going that way and this way -- you can feel the ball as if you were me. And you can't do that with a slide. You can't do it with a picture. You need to see it in the physical world. That's why I think that -- oh yes, of course, there are speed questions involved too that have to be separated out -- but I think the empathetic mirroring is why props and the use of a blackboard are so effective.

## Slides

Well let's see -- oh yes, there is one more thing by way of the tools and that has to do with the use of slides. I repeat, I think they're for exposing ideas, not for teaching ideas. But that's what we do in a job talk or conference talk -- we expose ideas, we don't teach them. So let me tell you a little bit about my views on that.

**Too many slides, too many words.** I remember once I was in Terminal A at Logan Airport. I just come back from a really miserable conference and the flight was really horrible -- it was one of those that feels like an unbalanced washing machine. And for the only time in my life I decided to stop on my way to my car and have a cup of coffee and relax a little bit. And as I was there for a few minutes someone came up to me and said "are you Professor Winston?" "I think so," I said. I don't know, I guess I was trying to be funny. In any event he said "I'm on my way to Europe to give a job talk, would you mind critiquing my slides?" "Not at all," I said. "You have too many and they have too many words." "How did you know?" he said, thinking perhaps I'd seen a talk of his before. I hadn't. My reply was "because it's always true -- there are always too many slides, always too many words."

**The crimes demonstration.** So let me show you some extreme examples of how not to use slides. Well, for this demonstration I need to be way over here. And when I get over here then I can start to say things like: one of the things you shouldn't do is read your transparencies. People in your audience know how to read and reading will just annoy them. Also you should be sure that you have only a few words on each transparency and that the words are easy to read.

And I hope it's driving you crazy because I'm committing all kinds of crimes. The first of which is that there are too many words on this slide. Second of which is I'm way over there and the slide is way over there, so you get into this tennis match feeling of shifting back and forth between the slide and the speaker. You want the slides to be condiments to what you're saying, not the main event, or the opposite way around.

**Fixing the crimes.** So how can we fix this? Step number one is to get rid of the background junk -- that's always a distraction. Step number two is to get rid of the words. When I reduced the words to these then everything I read a previous time I'm not licensed to say because it's not on the slide. I'm not reading my slides anymore but I'm saying what was written on the slides in a previous example.

So what else can we do to simplify this? Well we can get rid of the logos -- we don't need them. Simplification. What else can we do? Get rid of the title. "Now I want to talk to you about some rules for slide preparation" -- I'm telling you the title, it doesn't have to be up there.

By reducing the number of words on the slide I'm allowing you to pay more attention to me and less to what's written on the slide. I mentioned it before -- we have only one language processor and we can either use it to read stuff or to listen to the speaker. And so if we have too many words on the slide it forces people in the audience to read this stuff and not listen.

**The experiment.** A student of mine did an experiment a few years ago. He taught some students some web-based programming ideas. Half the information was on slides, he said the other half. And then for a control group he reversed it. And the question was what did the subjects -- that is to say, freshmen in his fraternity -- what did the subjects remember best? What he said or what they read on the slide? And the answer is what they read on the slide. When their slides have a lot of material on it they don't pay attention to the speaker. In fact in the after action report one of the subjects said "I wish you hadn't talked so much, it was distracting."

Well that last item is eliminate clutter. I hear some clutter. No no no -- no reason even for those bullets. So the too many words problem is a consequence of a crime Microsoft has committed by allowing you to use fonts that are too small. So you should all have a sample slide like this that you can use to determine what the minimum font size is that's easily legible. Shiv, what do you think of those? Which size is right? "That size is right." Yeah, minimum maybe 40 or 50. Yeah he says 40 or 50, I think it's about right. 35 is getting too small -- not necessarily because you can't read it but because you're probably using it to get too many words on the slide.

**The laser pointer crime.** What other crimes do we have? Well we have the laser pointer crime. Not for that -- you know in the old days when we didn't have laser pointers we used wooden ones and people would go waving these things around and pretty soon it became almost like a baton-twirling contest. So here's what I recommended in the old days for dealing with this kind of pointer -- this example of use of a prop. Jim Glass up there saw this talk about 20 years ago and so -- "oh yeah, I remembered that talk, that's the one where you broke the pointer." It's amazing how props tend to be the things that are remembered.

Well now we don't have physical pointers anymore. We've got laser pointers. It's a wonder more people aren't driven into epileptic fits over this sort of stuff. But here's what tends to happen -- look at that, it's a lovely recursive picture and I can become part of it by putting that laser beam right on the back of my head up there. And what do you see? You see the back of my head. I have no eye contact, no engagement, nothing. I was sitting with a student watching a talk one day and she said "you know what, we could all leave and he wouldn't know."

So what happens when you use a laser pointer -- you can't use a laser pointer without turning your head and pointing it at something. And when you do that you lose contact with the audience. You don't want to do it. So what do you do if you need to identify something in your image and you don't want to point at it with a laser? This is what you do -- put a little arrow on there and say "now look at that guy number one at the end of arrow number one." You don't need to have a laser pointer to do that.

**The too-heavy crime.** When people ask me to review a presentation I ask them to print it out and lay it out on a table. When they do that it's easy to see whether the talk is too heavy -- too much text, not enough air, not enough white space, not enough imagery. This is a good example of such a talk -- way too heavy. The presenter has taken advantage of small font sizes to get as much on the slide as he wanted. Lots of crimes here but the too-heaviness, the fact that it's too heavy, is what I wanted to illustrate.

So here by contrast another talk, one I gave a few years ago. It wasn't a deeply technical talk but I show it to you because there's air in it. It's mostly pictures of things. There are three or four slides that have text on them but when I come to those I give the audience time to read them, and they're there because they might have some historical significance. The first slide with a lot of text on it is an extraction from the proposal for the 1957 AI conference at Dartmouth -- extraordinarily interesting event. And that historical extraction from the proposal helps drive that point home.

**Hapax legomenon.** What else have we got here? Oh yeah, your vocabulary word for the day -- this is a hapax legomenon. What that means is this is the kind of slide you can get away with exactly once in your presentation. This is a slide that got some currency some years ago because it shows the complexity of governing in Afghanistan by showing how impossibly complex it is. It's something we in the audience can't understand -- and that's the point. But you can't have many of these. You can have one per presentation, one per paper, one per book. That's what a hapax legomenon is. And this is an example of it.

**Crimes in the wild.** Well I've shown you some crimes and so you might be asking do these crimes actually occur? So they do. There's the hands in the pockets crime. There's a crime in time and place selection -- here, this is how you get to the Bartos Theater. First thing you do is you get down these steps over at the Media Lab, then you cross this large open space, then you turn right down this corridor -- at this point whenever I go in there I wonder if there are torture implements around the corner. And then when you get in there you get into this dark gloomy place. So it's well-named when they call it the Bartos Theater because it's a place where you can watch a movie but it's not a place where you can give a talk.

Now on a subject that doesn't happen -- here's a talk I attended a while back in Strata. Notice that the speaker is far away from the slides, speaker is using a laser pointer. And you say to me "well what's happening here?" It's, by the way, the 80th slide in the presentation. Notice that it's dense with words. This is the first of 10 conclusion slides. So what's the audience reaction? That's the sponsor of the meeting -- he's reading his email. This is the co-sponsor of the meeting -- he's examining the lunch menu. What about this person? This person looks like he's paying attention, but this -- because it's a still picture -- if you were to see a video what you would see is something like this. [Sleeping gesture.] So yeah, it does happen.
