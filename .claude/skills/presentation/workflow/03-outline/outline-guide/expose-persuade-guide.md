# Expose / Persuade Outline Guide

**Persona refinement: Speechwriter** -- Think in narrative arc, persuasive structure, audience journey. The goal is showcasing accomplishments or proving capability.

## Why Packaging Matters

Winston attended a fundraising event to save Venice from going underwater. He was seated next to Julia Child. As the evening wore on, person after person approached her -- asking for autographs, telling her she'd changed their life. It happened over and over.

Eventually Winston turned to her and said "Miss Child, is it fun to be famous?" She thought about it for a second and said "you get used to it."

But you never get used to being ignored.

Your ideas are like your children and you don't want them to go into the world in rags. The techniques in this guide exist so that your ideas are recognized for the value that is in them. Caring about packaging is not vanity -- it's stewardship of your own work.

## The Sandwich Structure

Every expose/persuade talk follows the same architecture. Winston calls it a sandwich:

**Top bread:** Vision + done-something (first 5 minutes)
**Filling:** The body of the talk
**Bottom bread:** Contributions (final slide, stays up during Q&A)

The contributions mirror the done-something enumeration. The audience hears what you've accomplished at the beginning and sees it crystallized at the end. Everything in between develops the evidence.

This structure applies beyond job talks -- any presentation where you're exposing or persuading needs vision + done-something + contributions.

## Vision and Accomplishment: The Five-Minute Window

Winston was sitting in a bar in San Diego. He was a member of the Navy Science Board, drinking with two colleagues:

- **Dolores Etter** from the University of Colorado. She'd written 21 books (Winston had only written 17 -- "she made me so jealous I could spit").
- **Bill Weldon** from the University of Texas. An electromagnetism guy who knew how to use rail guns to drive steel rods through tank armor. "These are interesting people."

Winston asked: "What do you look for in a faculty candidate?"

Within one microsecond Dolores said: "They have to show us they've got some kind of vision."

Quickly followed by Bill: "They have to show us that they've done something."

"How long does the candidate have to establish these two things?"

Five minutes.

If you haven't expressed your vision and demonstrated accomplishment in five minutes, you've already lost. This is the constraint that shapes everything in an expose/persuade talk. The first five minutes are not warmup. They are the talk.

### What Vision Means

**Vision = a problem somebody cares about + something new in your approach.**

Winston demonstrates with his own stump speech -- the one he uses to open most talks on his research:

"The problem is understanding the nature of human intelligence. The approach is asking questions about what makes us different from chimpanzees and Neanderthals. Is it merely a matter of quantity -- are we just a little bit smarter in some continuous way -- or do we have something that's fundamentally different that the chimpanzees don't have and the Neanderthals either? And the answer is yes, we do have something different. We are symbolic creatures. And because we're symbolic creatures we can build symbolic descriptions of relations and events. We can string them together and make stories. And because we can make stories, that's what makes us different."

Notice the structure: problem (understanding human intelligence), approach (comparative question), answer (symbolic creatures, stories). It's concrete. It's surprising. And it establishes both the problem's importance and the speaker's angle on it.

### What Done-Something Means

You demonstrate accomplishment by enumerating the steps needed to achieve the solution. Winston's key insight: you don't have to have completed all of them. You enumerate the full path, then show where you are on it.

His example: "Here's what needs to be done. We need to specify some behavior. We need to enumerate the constraints that make it possible to deal with that behavior. We have to implement a system because we're engineers and we don't think that we've understood something unless we can build it. And we've built such a system and we're about to demonstrate it to you today."

The audience sees the full picture AND your position in it. Incomplete work presented this way is stronger than completed work presented without context, because the audience can evaluate the quality of your thinking, not just your output.

## Winston's Star: Making Your Talk Memorable

Winston's Star is a framework for ensuring your work gets remembered. Every element starts with S. Winston discovered it retrospectively -- his PhD thesis on arch learning became "mildly famous" and he didn't know why until years later when he realized it accidentally had all five elements.

Use the Star as a design checklist during outlining. If your talk is missing elements, it's at risk of being forgotten no matter how good the content is.

### Symbol

You need a visual or conceptual symbol associated with your work. Winston's was the arch itself -- a simple, instantly recognizable image that stands for the entire body of research. When people think of his work, they see the arch.

What image, diagram, or concept can serve as the visual anchor for your talk? This isn't a logo -- it's the thing people will draw on a napkin when explaining your work to someone else.

### Slogan

A phrase that provides a handle on the work. Winston's was "one-shot learning" -- the program learned something definite from every single example presented to it. Two words that capture the surprise and the contribution.

Your slogan should be short enough to repeat verbatim. If someone asks "what was that talk about?" the slogan is what gets said. It's the compression of your entire contribution into a phrase.

### Surprise

What's the unexpected element? For Winston: you don't need a million examples to learn something. You can do it with one example if you're smart enough to make use of it appropriately. The surprise contradicts an assumption the audience walked in with.

The surprise is often the reason the work matters. If nothing is surprising, the audience wonders why they're hearing about it. Identify the assumption your work violates.

### Salient Idea

Not the most important idea -- the one that sticks out. Winston is precise about this distinction: "Some theses, funnily enough, have too many good ideas and you don't know what it's all about because which one is it?" Having too many good ideas is almost as bad as having none, because salience gets diluted.

Winston's salient idea was the "near miss" -- showing the system something that's not an arch but doesn't miss by much. The concept of a near miss is graspable, visual, and gives people something to hook the rest of the work onto.

You need one idea that sticks out from the others. If everything is equally prominent, nothing is prominent. Pick the one that's most graspable and let the others orbit around it.

### Story

Tell the story of how you did it, how it works, why it's important. This is the narrative arc that connects symbol, slogan, surprise, and salient idea into a coherent journey.

The story isn't just "what happened." It's the narrative structure that makes the other four elements make sense together. Without the story, you have a collection of clever elements. With the story, you have something people will retell.

## Oral Exams and Practice

Winston's advice on oral exams applies to any high-stakes expose/persuade situation: thesis defenses, board presentations, investor pitches, job interviews.

### Situate Your Work

The most common reason people fail oral exams is failure to situate. Situating means placing your work in context -- in time, in place, in field. "This is a problem that's been pursued all over the world. There hasn't been any progress in the past 30 years. Everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things."

Without situating, the audience can't evaluate the significance of what you've done. They might think your problem is trivial, or well-solved, or irrelevant. Situating prevents all three.

### Practice with the Right People

Practice is important, but practicing with the wrong people is worse than useless. If people know what you're doing, they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there. It isn't there.

Your faculty supervisor is particularly bad for this. They know your work intimately and will fill in gaps mentally that the audience will fall into.

Winston's prescription: get together friends who don't know what you're doing. Start the practice session by saying "if you can't make me cry I won't value you as a friend anymore." You need people who will tell you where your talk fails, not people who will nod along because they already know the content.

### Difficulty is Proportional to Age

The amount of criticism you get from someone is inversely proportional to their seniority. Older examiners understand where they are in the world. Younger ones are trying to show the older ones how smart they are -- "savagely vicious." Whenever you have an opportunity to choose an examining committee full of people with gray hair, that's what you want.

This applies to practice too: if young colleagues shred your talk, the actual audience of senior people will be gentler. Calibrate accordingly.

## Brainstorm 1: Vision

**Deliverable:** `04-outline/01-vision.md`

Draft the vision statement from the shape compilation. Apply Winston's formula:

**Vision = a problem somebody cares about + something new in your approach.**

Model it on Winston's stump speech structure:
1. Name the problem (understanding human intelligence)
2. Frame your approach as a question (what makes us different from chimps?)
3. Give the answer that reveals your angle (we're symbolic creatures)
4. Connect it to why this matters (stories are what make us human)

Keep it to 2-4 sentences that can be delivered in under 2 minutes. This must land in the first 5 minutes of the talk.

**Star check:** Does this vision contain or set up the Symbol, Slogan, and Surprise? If not, where in the opening will those appear?

Present for user reaction.

---

## Brainstorm 2: Done Something

**Deliverable:** `04-outline/02-done-something.md`

Enumerate the steps needed to achieve the solution. Remember: you don't have to have completed all of them. The power is in showing the full path and your position on it.

List the steps, marking which are complete:
```markdown
# Steps to the Solution

1. [Step] -- done
2. [Step] -- done
3. [Step] -- in progress / demo-ready
4. [Step] -- future work
```

This enumeration serves double duty: it demonstrates accomplishment AND provides the audience a roadmap for the rest of the talk. They know where you're going and can track your progress through the presentation.

Combined with the vision, this must fit in the first 5 minutes.

---

## Brainstorm 3: Contributions

**Deliverable:** `04-outline/03-contributions.md`

The mirror of done-something. The contributions slide is the most important slide in the deck -- it's what's up there while people are asking questions and filing out. It tells people who you are.

List 3-5 contributions in concrete, accomplishment language:
```markdown
# Contributions

1. [What you accomplished -- concrete, not vague]
2. [What you accomplished]
3. [What you accomplished]
```

**Star check:** Does the Salient Idea appear prominently in the contributions? Is the Slogan reflected? The contributions slide should feel like the crystallized version of the Star.

---

## Brainstorm 4: Sections

**Deliverable:** `04-outline/04-sections.md`

Now structure the talk body. The first 5 minutes are spoken for (vision + done-something). The body develops the evidence. The end mirrors with contributions.

```markdown
# Sections

## 1. [Vision + Done Something] [slides]
First 5 minutes. Vision statement. Steps enumerated.
Situating: time, place, field context.

## 2. [Section Name] [slides]
What this covers. How it connects to the vision.

## 3. [Section Name] [slides|board]
What this covers. Where the surprise lands.

...

## N. [Contributions] [slides]
Final slide. Stays up during Q&A.
```

Default to `[slides]` for expose/persuade. Use `[board]` only for sections where you're teaching a concept live and want empathetic mirroring -- drawing a diagram, building an idea piece by piece.

**Slide discipline:** Winston's universal truth -- there are always too many slides and always too many words. Plan for fewer slides than you think you need.

---

## Brainstorm 5: Delivery

**Deliverable:** `04-outline/05-delivery.md`

```markdown
# Delivery Plan

## Opening (first 5 minutes)
[Empowerment promise. Vision statement. Done-something enumeration.
Situating: time/place/field context.]

## Star Elements
- Symbol: [what visual/concept anchors the talk]
- Slogan: [the handle phrase]
- Surprise: [the violated assumption]
- Salient idea: [the one that sticks out]
- Story: [the narrative arc connecting them]

## Verbal Punctuation Points
- Before section 2: ...
- After section 3: ...

## Questions
- After section 2: "[question]" (purpose: ...)
- During section 4: "[question]" (purpose: ...)

## Cycling
- Concept A: introduced in section 2, revisited in section 4 from [angle]

## Props
Physical:
- [prop name]: [what it demonstrates] -- [how to source/build]

Narrative sequences (story synopsis, case study, multi-scene anecdote):
- [story name]: [what narrative it walks through]
  - Cast: [character name] ([description, role]) / [character name] ([description, role])
  - Scene plan (point drives the visual):

    | # | Point (what you say) | Characters | Scene | Disposition |
    |---|----------------------|------------|-------|-------------|
    | 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
    | 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Illustration sequences (2-frame prop adaptation):
- [prop name]: Frame 1 [setup] / Frame 2 [insight]

## Closing
Final slide: Contributions
- [contribution 1]
- [contribution 2]
- [contribution 3]

Final words: [joke / benediction / salute]
```

**Practice plan:** Identify 2-3 people who don't know your work well. Schedule a practice session. Tell them to make you cry. If your practice audience can follow the vision in the first 5 minutes without knowing your work, the real audience will too.

## Lock-In

Synthesize all brainstorms (vision + done-something + contributions + sections + delivery) into `04-outline.md`. This is the compilation the Specify stage reads.
