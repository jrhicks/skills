# Outline Guide

Common instructions for all presentation types. Read this first, then the label-specific guide.

The section outline is the gateway bottleneck between intellectual design (Shape) and production work (Specify/Produce). Everything above it is discovering what to say; everything below is deciding how to say it and building it.

## Time and Place

Before planning the section outline, understand the physical and temporal constraints. Winston is explicit: these choices determine whether anyone will be awake to hear your ideas.

### Time

**11:00 AM is optimal.** Most people are awake by then, hardly anyone is going back to sleep, it's not right after a meal, and people aren't fatigued. This timing gives you the best shot at engaged attention.

For virtual presentations, consider time zones and meeting fatigue. Avoid the post-lunch slot where you're fighting digestion.

### Place

**Keep the lights full up.** The most important property of a place is that it be well lit. Humans react to dim lighting as a sleep signal. When Winston arrives at a venue, the first thing he tells audiovisual staff is "keep the lights full up." They protest: "People will see the slides better if we turn the lights off." His reply: "It's extremely hard to see slides through closed eyelids."

**Case the room.** Visit the space beforehand like you're robbing a bank. Check for weirdnesses: odd acoustics, strange sight lines, awkward podium placement, missing equipment. Sometimes you can intervene. Sometimes you just need to know what challenges to expect.

Winston's technique: When he arrives, he imagines all the seats filled with disinterested farm animals. That way, no matter how bad it actually is, it won't be as bad as that.

**Right-size the room.** The space should be more than half full. Ten people in a 200-seat hall makes everyone wonder what's so much more interesting that nobody came. Get a right-sized place. It doesn't have to be packed, but it has to feel populated.

## Media Plan: Board vs Slides

For each section, decide the medium. Winston is clear about when to use each:

**Board** (blackboard/whiteboard) -- best for **informing**. Three virtues:

1. **Graphic quality** -- you can draw, diagram, visualize naturally
2. **Speed** -- writing speed matches the speed people absorb ideas (slides flip too fast)
3. **Target** -- gives you something to do with your hands and creates engagement via empathetic mirroring

**Slides** -- best for **exposing** ideas (job talks, conference talks). Not for teaching.

**Virtual adaptation:** In virtual presentations, "board" means chalkboard sequence slides -- 2 back-to-back slides that progressively reveal a drawing on a green chalkboard background. These are a deliberate mode switch from polished slides. See the **pptx** skill's chalk-board guide for the workflow.

**The empathetic mirroring principle:** When you watch someone write on a board or manipulate a physical object, mirror neurons in your brain activate. You feel yourself doing it. You can't get that with a slide or a picture. You need to see it in the physical world. This is why students always say "more chalk, less PowerPoint" and why props are so effective.

Winston watched Seymour Papert give a lecture twice -- first to absorb content, second to note style. Papert constantly pointed at the board. None of the stuff he was pointing to had anything to do with what he was saying. Nevertheless, it was effective.

Mark each section: `[board]`, `[slides]`, or `[board+slides]` (mixed).

## Props Planning

Props are the domain of playwrights, but speakers can use them too. Props create empathetic mirroring and are profoundly memorable.

**Henrik Ibsen's *Hedda Gabler*:** Winston saw this play decades ago. A woman in an unhappy marriage, her husband competing for an academic job with someone who has written a magnificent manuscript. The stage has a pot-bellied stove with an open door. At the beginning, just glowing embers. As tension mounts, the fire gets bigger and hotter, finally all-consuming. You just know that manuscript is going into that fire. Winston remembers this about the play many years later. Playwrights have this figured out.

**Seymour Papert's bicycle wheel:** Demonstrates how thinking about a problem the right way trumps fancy education. Start the wheel spinning, apply torque to the axle (or blow on the edge). Which way does it go? Mechanical engineers recall the right-hand rule, fumble with their fingers, and get it right with about 50% probability. Their fancy education makes them equivalent to flipping a coin.

But you can think differently. Put duct tape around part of the wheel. Think only about the piece under the tape. As it comes rolling over the top, you blow on it with a puff of air -- forgetting the rest of the wheel, what happens to that little piece? It wants to go that way because you bang on it like that, it's already going down like that. Next piece? Same. Next? Same. The wheel must go over. Now you'll never wonder again because you're thinking about the problem the right way. Demonstrated by a prop. You can try this.

**Alan Lazarus's pendulum:** Teaching conservation of energy in 26-100. Long wire in the ceiling attached to a steel ball. Lazarus takes the ball up against the wall, puts his head flat against the wall to steady himself, and lets go. The pendulum takes many seconds to swing over and back, then gently kisses his nose. You have many seconds to think "this guy really believes in the conservation of energy."

Do not try this at home. The first time, you may not just let go -- there's a natural human tendency to push.

**Jim Glass's memory:** Winston broke a wooden pointer in a talk 20 years earlier. Glass remembered: "Oh yeah, that's the one where you broke the pointer." Props are what stick.

**Planning questions:**
- What physical objects could illustrate core concepts?
- What could the audience manipulate themselves (hands-on)?
- What creates tension, surprise, or visceral understanding?
- What would people remember 20 years later?

**Virtual adaptation:** Physical props become **prop sequences** -- paired illustration slides showing the professor presenting and then demonstrating the prop. Frame 1 is setup (holding the object, calm), Frame 2 is insight (pointing at the key detail, animated). These are editorial-style illustrations, NOT chalkboard aesthetic. See `guides/prop-sequences.md` for the visual style, prompt templates, and reference examples.

**Narrative props** are multi-frame story sequences that accompany verbal storytelling -- walking the audience through a book synopsis, case study, or extended anecdote with consistent characters across 3-7 different scenes. Unlike illustration sequences (2 frames, one prop, one setting), narrative sequences depict completely different settings with recurring characters. The character reference sheet pattern ensures visual consistency across frames. See `guides/story-sequences.md` for the full workflow.

For each prop, note the adaptation: `[prop: physical]`, `[prop: illustration sequence]`, `[prop: narrative sequence]`, or `[prop: video]`.

## Delivery Planning

After the section outline, plan how to deliver it using Winston's techniques.

### Cycling

Go around the subject multiple times. Not because the audience is unintelligent -- at any given moment about 20% will be fogged out. Someone's thinking about lunch. Someone just got bad news. Someone's processing the previous concept. Cycling ensures the probability that everyone gets it is high.

Winston's version: "Tell them what you want to tell them, tell them again, and then tell them a third time."

Plan where to cycle: which core ideas need to be revisited? How will you circle back? A concept introduced in section 2 might get reinforced in section 4 from a different angle.

### Building a Fence

Distinguish your idea from others' ideas. If you were from Mars and Winston was teaching you about arches, he might say: "That's an arch. And that's not to be confused with some other things that other people might think is an arch. This is not an arch. That's not an arch." He's building a fence around the idea so it can be distinguished from somebody else's idea.

In technical contexts: "My algorithm might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential and mine is linear." That fence prevents confusion about how your idea relates to others.

This fence carries forward from the Shape phase. You already built a fence in the Identify section. Now plan how to reinforce it in delivery: where do you explicitly contrast with alternatives?

### Verbal Punctuation

Provide landmark moments where people can get back on the bus. Enumerate. Announce structure. "The first idea is X. The second idea is Y. And now the third idea is Z." Seams in the talk let people re-engage.

Winston demonstrates: "This is my outline. The first thing we're going to do is talk about how to start. Then we're going to deal with these four samples. And among these four samples I've talked about the first idea, that's cycling. The second idea, building a fence. And now the third idea is verbal punctuation." He's enumerating. He's providing numbers. He's giving a sense that there's a seam in the talk and you can get back on.

Plan where to place verbal punctuation: section transitions, before key concepts, after complex material. These become markers in the spec.

### Questions

Carefully chosen questions re-engage the audience. Winston demonstrates with a question about what the fourth heuristic might be (answer: asking a question). You can wait about 7 seconds of silence for an answer -- it feels like eternity but is the standard. The question can't be too obvious (embarrassing to answer) or too hard (nobody will say anything).

Plan 2-4 questions and where they go. Each question should have a purpose: re-engagement, check understanding, or create surprise.

### How to Start

**Don't start with a joke.** People are still settling in and adjusting to vocal parameters. Jokes fall flat. At the beginning, people are putting laptops away, becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters. They're not ready for a joke.

**Start with the empowerment promise** from the Shape. Tell people what they will know at the end that they didn't know at the beginning. It's their reason for being there.

Winston's example: "At the end of this 60 minutes you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life."

Plan the exact opening. What are the first 2-3 sentences? This is your empowerment promise from the Shape made concrete.

### Collaborators on the FIRST Slide

If you have collaborators, recognize them on the first slide, not the last. A gigantic list of collaborators at the end creates a letdown -- "there are a thousand faculty at MIT, nice piece of work but not so much if you divide by a thousand." Nobody knows who did significant work.

Put them on the first slide. Then your final slide can tell people who you are and what you accomplished.

### How to Stop

**Final slide:** "Contributions" (what you accomplished) -- not "Questions?", "Thank You", or "The End."

Winston lists the bad options:

- **Long list of collaborators** -- Suggests nobody knows who did significant work. Put them on the FIRST slide.
- **"Questions?"** -- Can be up there for 20 minutes. Squanders real estate. Squanders an opportunity to tell people who you are.
- **"Thank You"** -- Wastes opportunity. Nobody writes it down.
- **"The End"** -- Even worse. Does nothing for you.
- **"Conclusions"** -- Seems legitimate at first, but people don't care about conclusions. They care about what you have done.

**"Contributions" is correct.** It's a mirror of the job talk sandwich structure. The final slide -- the one that's up there while people are asking questions and filing out -- ought to be the one that has your contributions on it. It tells people who you are.

Winston's example from his own stump speech: "Here are the things I typically demonstrate. And this is what we get out of it." He waits for people to read it.

**Final words:** A joke, a benediction, or a salute to the audience. NOT "thank you" (implies they stayed out of politeness).

**A joke is okay at the end.** Doug Lenat, sitting in a bar in Austin, told Winston his secret: "I always finish with a joke. And that way people think they've had fun the whole time."

**"Thank you" is a weak move.** You will not go to hell if you conclude by saying thank you, but it's weak. When you say "thank you" -- even worse, "thank you for listening" -- it suggests that everybody stayed that long out of politeness and had a profound desire to be somewhere else but were so polite they stuck it out. That's what you're thanking them for. Once wild applause has started you can mouth a thank you. But the last thing you do should not be saying thank you.

**Benediction examples:**

Governor Christie's Republican keynote: "And together, everybody together, we will stand up once again for American greatness, for our children and grandchildren. God bless you and God bless America."

Bill Clinton's Democratic keynote (watch for the lip-pursing where he almost says "thank you" but forces himself not to): "If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote and you must reelect President Barack Obama. God bless you and God bless America." Then he purses his lips (stopping the "thank you") and gives a little salute.

**Other conventions:** Over time, cultures develop stock ways of ending things. In the Catholic church's Latin mass, it ended with "Ite, missa est" -- approximately "okay, the mass is over, you can go home now." At musical concerts, you know it's time to clap not at the end of the song but when the conductor shakes hands with the concertmaster. These are conventions that signal the event is over.

**Salute the audience:** Say something about how much you value your time and place. "It's been great fun being here. It's been fascinating to see what you folks are doing here. I've been stimulated and provoked by the kinds of questions you've been asking. It's been really great. And I look forward to coming back on many occasions in the future."

Plan both: the final slide content and the final spoken words.
