# Shape Guide

Work through 3 brainstorm sessions to extract the presentation's core. Each session covers a cluster of Winston's techniques. Lead with proposals drawn from the brain-dump -- the user reacts and refines.

---

## Session 1: Grounding

**Goal:** Establish who you're talking to and what territory this talk covers.

### Audience

Who are they? What do they already know? What's their starting position?

Winston surveyed people across MIT about what inspires them. Incoming freshmen were inspired by teachers who told them they could do it. Senior faculty were inspired by someone who helped them see a problem in a new way. Everyone was inspired by someone who exhibited **passion**.

Know your audience well enough to calibrate what will move them.

### Situating

Place the work in context. Winston says the most common reason people fail oral exams is **failure to situate** -- they dive into details without establishing what problem exists, how long it's been unsolved, and why it matters.

Even for an inform-type talk, situating tells the audience why this topic deserves their attention right now.

### Fencing

Distinguish your idea from others' ideas. Winston's heuristic: "My algorithm might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential and mine is linear." Fencing prevents confusion about how your idea relates to what the audience already knows.

Define what the talk is NOT about. This protects against scope creep and sets expectations.

### Deliverable

Write `03-shape/01-grounding.md` with:
- Audience description (who, what they know, what they need)
- Situating statement (context that frames the talk)
- Fencing statement (what this is NOT about)

Present to user for reaction, then write the file.

## Session 2: Core

**Goal:** Find the one idea that sticks, the story that carries it, and the surprise that hooks attention.

### Salient Idea

Not just important -- **prominent**. Winston warns that a thesis with too many good ideas can fail because none sticks out. You need ONE salient idea the audience walks away with. Everything else supports it.

Propose candidates from the brain-dump. Ask: "If the audience remembers exactly one thing from this talk, what should it be?"

### Story

We are storytelling animals. We develop story skills from fairy tales through professional school. Teaching people to think means providing stories they need, questions to ask about those stories, mechanisms for analysis, ways to combine them, and ways to evaluate reliability.

The story IS the talk structure -- not a decoration on top of content.

### Surprise

Something unexpected that reframes how the audience sees the topic. Winston's example: a coloring algorithm that takes longer than the lifetime of the solar system -- but with one adjustment, finishes in seconds. "Isn't that cool?"

Surprise creates the memorable moment. Propose candidates: what's the "isn't that cool?" moment in this material?

### Deliverable

Write `03-shape/02-core.md` with:
- Salient idea (the one thing)
- Story (narrative arc)
- Surprise (the unexpected element)

Present to user for reaction, then write the file.

## Session 3: Packaging

**Goal:** Create the handles that make the talk stick and spread.

These are Winston's Star elements -- the sugar that makes ideas memorable and shareable. They may crystallize immediately or emerge later during outlining. It's OK to mark them TBD.

### Symbol

A visual or icon associated with the work. Winston's PhD on arch learning -- the arch itself became the symbol. Symbols give people a mental anchor.

Propose from the brain-dump: is there an image, diagram, or object that captures the core idea?

### Slogan

A phrase that provides a handle. Winston's: "one-shot learning." Short enough to remember, specific enough to distinguish.

Draft candidates. A good slogan passes the "bar conversation test" -- could someone repeat it to a friend?

### Empowerment Promise

What the audience will know or be able to do at the end that they couldn't before. Winston opens every talk with this: "At the end of this 60 minutes you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things will make a difference in your life."

The empowerment promise is their reason for being there. Draft it concretely.

### Deliverable

Write `03-shape/03-packaging.md` with:
- Symbol (or TBD with candidates)
- Slogan (or TBD with candidates)
- Empowerment promise (concrete statement)

Present to user for reaction, then write the file.

## Lock-In

After all 3 sessions, synthesize into `03-shape.md`. This is the **compilation** -- the locked-in shape that downstream stages read. Brainstorm files stay as reference but don't drive downstream work.

Structure of `03-shape.md`:

```markdown
# Shape: [Presentation Title]

## Audience
[who, what they know, what they need]

## Situating
[context that frames the talk]

## Fencing
[what this is NOT about]

## Salient Idea
[the one thing]

## Story
[narrative arc]

## Surprise
[the unexpected element]

## Symbol
[visual handle, or TBD]

## Slogan
[verbal handle, or TBD]

## Empowerment Promise
[what they'll know/be able to do after]
```

Present the full compilation for user approval before completing the stage.
